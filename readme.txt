This program converts programs from int, unsigned int, char, unsigned char, long and double. 
It takes 2 command line arguements instead of inputs which will take in a data type and denary value and output it's binary equivalent to terminal
.When it is run with no command line arguements it enables the unit testing for each data type conversion, the testing looks over
normal, extreme and erreneous cases. I've written my code with the DRY principle where I tried
to reuse functions as much as possible, along with helper functions for binary conversion
and turning each arguement into numeric form from strings.
