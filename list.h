/* This is a library module supporting lists. A list stores any number of itemloads
and has a current itemload, which can be any itemload from the first itemload to the
last itemload or a unique 'none' position indicating
that no itemload is selected. Every operation is constant time.
The lists provided by this module are not thread safe. */
